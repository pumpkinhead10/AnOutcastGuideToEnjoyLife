# An-Outcasts-Guide-For-Outcasts-To-Enjoy-Life

There was once a man named Smith. Smith always dressed according to the latest trends. But here’s the catch—when you dress like a celebrity and someone falls for you, are they truly falling for you, or for the image you’ve borrowed from someone they admire? If Smith were to dress, speak, and behave with total disregard for trends or social norms, would the same girl even notice him?
This is the problem with authenticity and conformity. People always say, “Be yourself.” But the truth is, when you’re truly yourself—raw, unfiltered, and without regard for society’s unwritten rules—you often become invisible. Say you wear the same worn-out clothes to school, to parties, to every event. There might be strength in not caring what others think. After all, caring too much can make you a prisoner of public opinion. But eventually, that strength may turn into alienation. People stop seeing you. You fade into the background. You become invisible.
And that invisibility does matter.
Even the greatest genius amounts to nothing if no one hears them. History is full of tragic figures who had brilliance but no audience. Philosophy, science, mathematics—they didn’t survive just because they were profound. They survived because people remembered them, passed them on, gave them a stage. To be heard, to be remembered, to matter—you need presence. You need a place in society.
And here lies the contradiction: If you conform too much, you lose yourself and become a puppet of the crowd—a hollow echo of others. But if you choose full authenticity, you risk being shut out entirely. You miss out on life’s pleasures simply because you’re not playing the social game.
So should we all just conform for the sake of fitting in? No.
Should we all rebel and do whatever we want, society be damned?
Still no.
Presence is necessary. Without it, you're just torturing yourself.
Here’s how to exist within society—without becoming a slave to it and without alienating yourself.

## 1) Build a presence

Start by building an impression. You don’t need to copy everyone, but mirroring them a little can get you in the door faster. Play games they play. Join groups with shared interests. Develop niche skills—coding, music, sports, anything. Do well in class. Ask meaningful questions. But don’t overdo it—you’re not trying to be a teacher’s pet or the class know-it-all. Balance is key. 
## 2) Hangout with friends
Go places. Try things. But know your limits. Don’t overextend yourself trying to impress. If you're heading to a fancy place like a nightclub, dress the part—not because you're giving in, but because you're playing smart. Walking into a club in messy clothes won't make you a rebel—it’ll just make you invisible. People will ignore you. You’ll end up wasting your time and money. But if you go with a crew who already vibes with you, you can wear whatever you want. Until then, embrace strategic conformity. A boxer’s potential is wasted if he dies in a street fight before ever stepping in the ring. 
## 3) Make your shit cool
  Now, this is where you flip the script.
Why do people consider certain things beautiful or stylish? Because we associate “cool” with those we perceive as powerful, desirable, or high-status or most relatable. What’s “normal” in one society may be weird in another. In some remote tribes in Myanmar, white teeth are considered ugly—so they blacken them. In Victorian England, yellow teeth were fashionable because they symbolized access to sugar, a luxury of the rich. “Beauty” is just a reflection of who society chooses to admire.
By now, you should have a solid circle—friends, allies, connections. You’ve built credibility, maybe even status in academics or a skill. This is the time to slowly sneak your uniqueness into the mix. Rock that nightgown trouser with your sleek shirt. If someone asks, throw it off with a laugh: “It’s just style,” or “I’m too lazy to match.” Because now, people know you. They can’t dismiss you the way they would a stranger. They’ve already accepted you—and they’ll likely roll with it.
But be careful. If your life starts falling apart, people might associate your style with your downfall. The same people who embraced your uniqueness could begin to treat it as a warning sign. Keep your foundation strong.
## Final word
This world doesn’t reward those who isolate themselves—nor those who sell their souls for applause. The real trick? Learn the rules. Play the game. Win your space. Then change the game from the inside.
Be smart. Be strategic. And once you've got your foot in the door—
Be unapologetically you.
